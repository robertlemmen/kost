1. turn the input into a graphical model of nodes, edges, and nodeports, nodes
form a hierarchy of "contained" nodes. edges collapse into trunks
2. a GA uses this tree of nodes like an arc tree, ordering it while still
   preserving hierarchy (representation?). genetic ops reorder, we build a
   subpopulation with low numbers of crossings (not necessarily lowest possble
   number)
3. lay out onto sparse grid in this order along the diagonal, informed by
   ordering hints. extra points for trunks collappsing
4. force based optimization with added noise, criteria are subsystem cohesion,
   unique edge length (trunks do not count multiple times), fit into bounding
   box.
